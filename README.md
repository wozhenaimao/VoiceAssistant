# VoiceAssistant
A voice assistant who is able to run scripts locally and has access to ChatGPT4
small project i made for fun

use pip install -r requirements.txt
create a .env file and put your openai token as OPENAI_API_KEY

By doing a little testing this assistant can search the web, create and run games, host webpages and more
I am sure if looked further into, there are a whole lot more things it can do.
